                            Each device is made of a container (normally
                            cylinder, sometimes a box) which
                            has legs attached on the sides and a
                            mold on the bottom side that determines
                            how the piece (or product as I call it) is
                            formed. Cylinder is filled with clay then
                            a piston is placed on top. I hit the piston
                            with a hammer and with every impact
                            force produced by it extrudes clay out of
                            the cylinder in intervals - bigger the force
                            longer the interval.

                        <h1>The beginning</h1>
                        <h2>March 2019, Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2>
                        <p>
                            Original idea was to create recordings of work
                            made by the hammer while it extrudes clay out of
                            the cylinder - for precise measuring it was also
                            necessary to create a hammer that enabled measuring
                            exact force of impact for each hit. Later more
                            devices were introduced.
                            <br>
                            Each is made of a body (usually cylinder,
                            sometimes a box) which has legs attached on
                            the sides and a mold on the bottom that
                            determines how the piece (i. e. product) is formed.
                            Body is filled with clay then a piston is placed on
                            top. I hit the piston with a hammer and with every
                            impact clay is extruded out of the cylinder in intervals.
                            <br>
                            --> Original idea was abandoned due to problems listed below. I focused more on the creation
                            of different devices (five in total) and exploration of possibilites to create different
                            products: changing the diameter or even shape of container, changing the mould on the bottom
                            etc.
                            <br>
                            Problems I did not forsee:
                            -as more clay gets extruded the intervals, even tough the force delivered remains unchanged,
                            become longer because of clay’s own weight;
                            -position of the piston is not always vertical because it’s “fixed” to the body only with
                            its head; upper part is not touching anything so it starts to lean. Because of this it has
                            to be constantly checked and moved into correct position.
                            -device and hammer are both saperate units; device moves out of center of impact with each
                            hit and also needs to be reppositioned frequently.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Second phase</h1>
                        <h2>October 2019, Belgrade, Serbia</h2>
                        <p>
                            Second phase is an upgrade of the first
                            one as I had focused on the aestethics
                            of the device and elimination of the problems
                            which occured before.
                            <br>
                            There is only one device now instead of
                            five - this was made possible by welding a
                            laser-cut “head” onto the bottomside of the
                            cylinder (i.e. body); triangular head has a
                            hole cut in the center with the same diameter
                            as the body’s inside so clay can easily pass
                            trough; around it there are three holes for
                            the screws. To create different shapes laser-cut
                            mounts are attached onto the head with the screws.
                            Also problem with piston leaning in and whole
                            device moving out of the zone of hammer’s
                            impact is solved. For piston a guide is
                            placed on top of the body, thus creating
                            second fixed point (first is piston’s head)
                            that keeps it always in vertical position;
                            to keep the device in one place, new hammer
                            was made which has legs that attatch to the
                            legs of the device so they become connected.

                            The great scraping device #1 is a prototype
                            device which uses a blade set under an angle
                            to scratch clay in thin layers. It consists
                            of metal framework, a box for the clay with
                            no top side and with a bottom one that moves
                            up and down with the rotation of the screw beneath.
                            On the top of the framework are two rails on
                            which a 4 wheel plate is placed. on te front
                            of the plate a blade is attached.
                            <br> <br>
                            Clay is carefully placed into the box, so
                            there is no air pockets, then it is raised
                            untill the blade touches it - now it is set,
                            plate is then pushed away from the box, clay
                            is raised to desired height and a cut/scratch
                            is made. Whit each cut/scratch clay starts
                            to build up forming different textures
                            depending on how much clay was raised
                            between each cut/scratch.
