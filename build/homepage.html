                            <p>Each device is made of a container (normally
                                cylinder, sometimes a box) which
                                has legs attached on the sides and a
                                mold on the bottom side that determines
                                how the piece (or product as I call it) is
                                formed. Cylinder is filled with clay then
                                a piston is placed on top. I hit the piston
                                with a hammer and with every impact
                                force produced by it extrudes clay out of
                                the cylinder in intervals - bigger the force
                                longer the interval.

                                <h2>March 2019, Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2>
                                Original idea was to create recordings of
                                work made by the hammer while it extrudes
                                clay out of the cylinder - for precise
                                measuring it was necessary to create
                                a hammer that enabled me to determine
                                exact force off impact for each hit.
                                <br>
                                <u>Problems I did not forsee:</u> as more clay
                                gets trough the intervals, even tough
                                the force delivered remains unchanged,
                                become longer because of clay’s own
                                weight; alligment of the piston is not
                                always vertical, because the hammer and
                                the machine are two saperate pieces -
                                hammer’s head does not always land with
                                its centre on the piston (anomalities in
                                the cylinder and in shape of pistons head
                                also contribute to the movement of the
                                piston)

                                --> Original idea was later abandoned
                                due to probleems listed above. I focused
                                more on the creation of different machines
                                and exploration of possibilites
                                to create different products: changing
                                the diameter or even shape of container,
                                changing the mould on the bottom etc.

                                How to get rid of the problems?
                                New machine - just one machine with
                                possibility of changing moulds. Laser 
                                cut! A guide to hold the piston in vertical
                                position (interractive piece?) 
                                <br>
                                New hammer - made to be screwed onto 
                                the machine so they become one whole. 
                                (eliminates problem of machine going
                                away from the “impact field”). Posibillity 
                                of removeable legs - easier transport.
