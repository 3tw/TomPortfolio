                        Each device is made of a container (normally
                        cylinder, sometimes a box) which
                        has legs attached on the sides and a
                        mold on the bottom side that determines
                        how the piece (or product as I call it) is
                        formed. Cylinder is filled with clay then
                        a piston is placed on top. I hit the piston
                        with a hammer and with every impact
                        force produced by it extrudes clay out of
                        the cylinder in intervals - bigger the force
                        longer the interval.

                        <h1>The beginning</h1>
                        <h2>March 2019, Ljubljana, Slovenia</h2>
                        Original idea was to create recordings of work 
                        made by the hammer while it extrudes clay out of 
                        the cylinder - for precise measuring it was also 
                        necessary to create a hammer that enabled measuring 
                        exact force of impact for each hit. Later more 
                        devices were introduced. 
                        <br>
                        Each is made of a body (usually cylinder, 
                        sometimes a box) which has legs attached on 
                        the sides and a mold on the bottom that 
                        determines how the piece (i. e. product) is formed. 
                        Body is filled with clay then a piston is placed on 
                        top. I hit the piston with a hammer and with every 
                        impact clay is extruded out of the cylinder in intervals. 
                        <br>
                        -> Original idea was abandoned due to problems listed below. I focused more on the creation of different devices (five in total) and exploration of possibilites to create different products: changing the diameter or even shape of container, changing the mould on the bottom  etc. 
                        <br>
                        Problems I did not forsee: 
                        -as more clay gets extruded the intervals, even tough the force delivered remains unchanged,  become longer because of clay’s own weight;
                        -position of the piston is not always vertical because it’s “fixed” to the body only with its head; upper part is not  touching anything so it starts to lean. Because of this it has to be constantly checked and moved into correct position.
                        -device and hammer are both saperate units; device moves out of center of impact with each hit and also needs to be reppositioned frequently.

                        <h1>Second phase</h1>
                        <h2>October 2019, Belgrade, Serbia</h2>
                        Second phase is an upgrade of the first 
                        one as I had focused on the aestethics 
                        of the device and elimination of the problems 
                        which occured before. 
                        <br>
                        There is only one device now instead of 
                        five - this was made possible by welding a 
                        laser-cut “head” onto the bottomside of the 
                        cylinder (i.e. body); triangular head has a 
                        hole cut in the center with the same diameter 
                        as the body’s inside so clay can easily pass 
                        trough; around it there are three holes for 
                        the screws. To create different shapes laser-cut 
                        mounts are attached onto the head with the screws.
                        Also problem with piston leaning in and whole 
                        device moving out of the zone of hammer’s 
                        impact is solved. For piston a guide is 
                        placed on top of the body, thus creating 
                        second fixed point (first is piston’s head) 
                        that keeps it always in vertical position; 
                        to keep the device in one place, new hammer 
                        was made which has  legs that attatch to the 
                        legs of the device so they become connected.
